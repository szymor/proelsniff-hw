# Proelsniff hardware

Proelsniff is a sniffer of flat-related events for Proel&trade; doorphone systems.

Here you can find hardware design files for an electronic circuit and an enclosure related to the project. The device was tested with **KDC3905**. It should work with compatible interphone exchanges of other manufacturers, such as *Cyfral*, *Laskomex* or *Urmet*.

The work is in progress.
